# Cube-World-Server-Mod-Launcher

Supports injecting Cube World mods. DLLs must go in a folder called "Server_Mods".

If something doesn't work, make sure you have the latest release for the launcher and all your mods, along with Cube World.

If you need to update Cube World, you can use this: https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/CubeWorld-Cracker

## Installing
Get the latest executable from Releases and place it in the same folder as Cube.exe

## Installing Mods
A "Server_Mods" folder should be created in the same folder as Server.exe, and mods should be installed by moving them into the Server_Mods folder.
